# Steps to run the repo: 
# 1. Clone the repo -> git clone https://github.com/LiteLife99/Nodejs-Mongo-POC.git 2. cd into cloned directory 
# 3. nvm use 16 (14+ compatible) 
# 4. Install dependencies -> npm i 
# 5. To start application -> npm start, to start in watch mode for development -> npm run dev 
# 6. We can provide port and environment custom via env flags. 
# 7. Make sure to make changes in the config file as per your architecture resources. Typically the config file should come from AWS Secrets Manager during deployment and should not be hardcoded inside the repo. 
# 8. Npm run test to execute all unit tests. Coverage report will pop up in the terminal itself.
